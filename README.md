# 🎭 playwright-pytest-sandbox

A practice repository for learning and experimenting with end-to-end UI test automation using **Playwright** and **pytest**, built against [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

---

## 📌 About

This repo contains a collection of automated UI tests structured around the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern. It covers login flows, cart management, and checkout — with parametrized test cases, xfail markers for known broken users, and full tracing/video/screenshot capture on failure.
